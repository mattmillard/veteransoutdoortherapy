		question: "What does a fully funded hunt include?",

			"Selected participants attend at no cost. Support may include core travel, lodging, meals, field access, shared equipment, and activity expenses. The team confirms exactly what is included before each hunt.",
	},
	{
		question: "Do I need hunting experience or my own equipment?",
		answer:
			"Requirements differ by hunt. Use the application to share your experience, equipment access, licensing status, and support needs. The team and host can then explain preparation and whether the event is a good fit.",

		question: "How do hosts support ethical hunting and conservation?",
